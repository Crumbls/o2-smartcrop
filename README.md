# o2-smartcrop
A smart cropping library for WordPress.

You can select a focus point on an image, then regenerate thumbnails. Any crops will be focused based on the point selected.  

Still in early beta testing.  Looking at a lot of code clean up since it had to be implemented very quickly for a client.

Based off of the works of wp-smartcrop.

If you'd like to help develop or test this, please contact me at chase@o2group.com 

TODO:
- Finish rewrite of main class.
- Rework for post_content.
- Add any other image formats.
- Disable need to use a tool like "Regenerate Thumbnails" to regenerate the thumbnails once complete.
- Test, test, test.
- If it's working well, figure out if it goes to the repo.
